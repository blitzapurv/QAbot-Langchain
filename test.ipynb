As much as we are \\nimportant to utilise and protect the weak in the world, we are also causing irreparable damage to the \\nworld. Many climate scientists believe that without significant reductions in greenhouse gas \\nemissions, the 21st century will see temperatures rise by 3 to 8 degrees, climatic patterns piercingly \\nalter, ice sheets collapse, and seas rise several feet.   \\nWith the possible exception of another world war, a massive asteroid, a deadly pandemic, or global \\nwarming may be the only threats to our planet. The release of greenhouse gases such as carbon \\ndioxid e, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere is the primary driver of global warming. \\nPower plants are the primary generator of carbon dioxide.  A rise in the average temperature of the \\nearth's surface, especially one that is long enough to produce  climate change , is referred to as global \\nwarming.

Almost all experts \\nexamining the earth's climate record now agree that human actions, particularly the emission of \\ngreenhouse gases from smokesta cks, cars, and burning forests, are likely the most powerful force \\ndriving the trend.

Given below are some causes of globa l warming.   \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nLarge amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted by these power plants as a result of the combustion of \\nfossil fuels for electricity generation. About a quarter of the carbon dioxide released into the \\natmosphere comes from the combu stion of gasoline in automobile engines.   \\nBuildings, both commercial and residential, contribute more to global warming pollution than \\nautomobiles and trucks.
